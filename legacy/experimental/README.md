Words
=====

Words doesn't come in the way of you and your thoughts. It's a place to **just write**.

Words isn't like WordPress or Medium because it isn't a blogging platform. It's a thinking platform. It's been developed to provide the most comfortable environment for your mind to be able to just write.
